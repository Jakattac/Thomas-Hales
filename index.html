        <p>Tom Hales joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913. He was a part of a group of volunteers who planned to rise up
            in Cork
            during the 1916 Easter Rising, however they received last minute orders to stand down. By May 1916 Tom Hales
            and his
            brothers, Seán, Bob, and William, were fighting with the IRA in west Cork during the Irish War of
            Independence.</p>
        <p>Tom Hales was involved with the Irish Volunteer movement from its inception in November 1913. Elected a
            delegate at the
            Volunteer national convention in the Abbey Theatre in 1915, he was among the majority who voted for the
            election of the
            national executive.</p>
        <p>Hale was mobilised during Easter Rising and sent a number of dispatches to Cork requesting further
            instructions.
            Ultimately, however, there was no uprising in Cork to match that in Dublin. The Volunteers gave up their
            arms and were
            later arrested. Terence MacSwiney was arrested in Hales' home on 3 May 1916 and Hales himself escaped and
            went on the
            run. He stated that he was listed as 'wanted' in the Hue and Cry police gazette.</p>
        <p>In 1918, Hales took part in a raid on a British gunboat and held 25 armed Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC)
            members
            prisoner at Snugmore Castle. Hales took part in a decoy in assisting his elder brother, Seán, to escape
            after his arrest
            in connection with the German Plot. He was elected commandant of the 1st (Bandon) battalion (1917–19), and
            commander
            of Cork 3rd brigade, IRA, in January 1919.</p>
        <p>In December 1919, he took part in an ambush against the RIC at Kilbrittain and Bandon and was involved in the
            manufacgture of gunpowder for IRA munitions. By this point he was the commander of the Third Cork Brigade of
            the IRA. On
            July 1920, Hales along with Harte was arrested by soldiers from the Essex Regiment.[2] The pair were taken
            to a nearby
            military barracks, where they were severely beaten while being interrogated by officers of the regiment.
            However,
            neither Hales nor Harte gave up any information, and were eventually sent to a military hospital to
            recuperate. Hales
            was tried and was eventually sentenced to two years' penal servitude, which he served in Pentonville and
            Dartmoor
            prisons in England. He was commander of the Irish prisoners at Pentonville, but was released following a
            general amnesty
            after the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921. According to Tom Barry, Harte suffered brain damage and went
            insane
            before dying in Broadmoor Hospital</p>
